##  Shock Physics Summary - 6/25/24
  
Shock physics is mainly the investigation of effects of certain shock waves on different particles, highlighting the potential changes in structure, temperature, and viscosity. This can be used to model phase transitions, Geophyics/Planetary Sciences, molecular dynamic calculations, and the denotation of explosives. 

## Impedance Matching - 6/26/24
  
Impedance matching uses pressure-particle velocity graphs and position-time graphs to find the pressure of an unknown sample through the shock velocity properties of a known material. This technique aids with shock mitigation strategies, determining the peak stress of explosives, and discovering vulnerabilities in detonation.

## SOP (Streaked Optical Pyrometer) and SOP Calibration - 6/26/24
  
The SOP is used to track the amount of photons to determine the temperature of a dynamically compressed material; this complements the Visar technology in identifying shock breakout in a sample. 

## B1-B2 transition in shock-compressed MgO - 6/27/24

### Sample Preperation 
  
When preparing the sample, it is imperative that an antireflection coating is applied onto the surface to limit the photon back refelction at interface. 

### Laser Configuration
  
Depending on the use of either Omega-EP or Omege-60 one or two laser pulses focus on a specified diameter spot. By tweaking the intensity of the laser, pressure in the MgO sample will increase. 

### XRD measurements
  
Measuring the X-Ray diffraction is collimated through a Ta pinhole, which brings into line the diffraction and records their transmission geometry on specific detectors. The detectors store the x-ray energy which can be converted into units of luminescence that are photosimulated through a calibrated scanner. 

### Forward Model for XRD texture analysis
  
To predict the signal of crystal orientation, forward diffraction simulations are critical. The textural information modulates the intensity of powder direction in the azimuthal direction. The variation of this intensity can be calculated along the azimuth for both the B1 and B2 phase.
