Shock Physics Summary - 6/25/24
Shock physics is mainly the investigation of effects of certain shock waves on different particles, highlighting the potential changes in structure, temperature, and viscosity. This can be used to model phase transitions, Geophyics/Planetary Sciences, molecular dynamic calculations, and the denotation of explosives.
