Shock Physics Summary - 6/25/24
Shock physics is mainly the investigation of effects of certain shock waves on different particles, highlighting the potential changes in structure, temperature, and viscosity. This can be used to model phase transitions, Geophyics/Planetary Sciences, molecular dynamic calculations, and the denotation of explosives. 

Impedance Matching - 6/26/24
Impedence matching uses pressure-particle velocity graphs and position-time graphs to find the pressure of an unknown sample through the shock velocity properties of a known material. This technique aids with shock mitigation strategies, determining the peak stress of explosives, and discovering vulnerabilities in detonation.
